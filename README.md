<h1 align="center">Welcome to my Snake 👋</h1>

<br/>
This project is a snake game made for arcade machines.

I made it in 2 days with C++ and SFML library, during my 2nd year at Epitech Lille.

# ⚠️ Prerequisites
Make sure you have C++, SFML and make installed on your computer

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsfml-dev make
```

# ⚙️ Installation

Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/antoinepod/Snake.git
```

Go to the project directory

```sh
cd Snake
```

And compile it

```sh
make
```

# 🚀 Usage

To launch the game

```sh
./snake
```

# 🎮 How to Play
To play the game, you can use either the arrow keys or a joystick to control the snake's movement.

The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen and grow the snake as long as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

Enjoy playing Snake!
